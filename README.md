# Cognitive_Science_Run
Project for Intro to Unity

Our game consists of nine levels,Â each of them representing one discipline of the Cognitive Science Bachelor. All of them are recognizable by the backgrounds and monsters, which are unique for each level.
We not only designed the backgrounds and the monsters but also the player to give an extra feeling of Cognitive Science.

On your run to achieve your bachelor, you will meet some objects that can help you to reach your target, or keep you from doing so:
- coins: will help you to get one level forwards, giving you +10 points extra
- cell phone: doubles the points you get for ten seconds
- hourglass: doubles your speed for 5 seconds

To survive, you have to carefully avoid colliding with the monsters that you find on your way.

To go from one level to the following, at least 50 points, similar to how students have to reach 50% of the points in an exam, have to be achieved.
The player will then automatically find themselves in the next level.

Reaching 50 points in the last level 9 will lead a winner panel to open as the Bachelor's degree has been achieved.


Further, our game entails a main menu where the player can choose to look at a description of the game, go to the level menu or exit the game.
The level menu displays all the levels of the game.


Since our team was new to Unity, we had a lot of little difficulties along the way. Such as creating a new folder and moving files into it, which will result in Unity no longer recognizing the moved files and having to reassign them manually.
Another problem we faced was switching scenes since the transition would be so abrupt when testing that it resulted in us mostly failing the next level immediately.
We tried to solve this by adding a transition between the scenes that fades the level in.
The most prying problem was GitHub, as we had difficulties uploading new achievements and ended up overwriting the whole repository, deleting even our previous commits.

We hope to bring joy to every player, especially to every Coxi trying the game :)

Have fun!


We contacted Jule about our issues with github:
I have just managed to upload our project on GitHub. In the process, I encountered some problems and couldn't update the final changes anymore.
The problem could only be solved by deleting the repository and creating a new one.
This led to the loss of all commit messages previously created.

I would like to compensate for this with an approximate timeline:
- beginning of May: Beginning of our own project - formulating ideas
- mid-May: creating the first level with our own monster and looping background, as well as high score and score management
- end of May: adding powerUps and their design
- beginning of June: tackling minor problems with powerUp Manager
- mid-June: creation of the main menu and some levels
- end of June: finishing on the levels and adding the design to them, winner panel

Thank you for your understanding!
